# Analog-Clock
The application is designed on HTML, CSS and JS.

Three mathematical calculations:
1. For hour hand
    12 hrs = 360 deg
    1 hr = 30 deg
    Also moves due to some minutes
    60 mnts = 30 deg
    m mnt = m/2
    
    h hr = h*30 + m/2  ---------(i)
    
2. For minute hand
     60 mnts = 360 deg
     1 mnt = 6 deg
     m mnt = 6*m   ------------ (ii)
     
3. For second hand
     60 secs = 360 deg
     1 sec = 6 deg
     s sec = 6*s   --------------(iii)
